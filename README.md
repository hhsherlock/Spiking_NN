- 22.10.2024: Initial Commit
    yay


**HH_original.py**: the original code from https://github.com/swharden/pyHH.

**HH.py**: the new code I wrote with more structured classes and bug fixed. I also will add more types of channels and receptors on the neuron.

**run.ipynb**: running results with the HH_original

**test.ipynb**: ignore it for now, i use it to test my new HH.py

**neuron.py**: ignore it as well, it is empty. I plan to add different kinds of neurons with different combinations with channels and receptors.
