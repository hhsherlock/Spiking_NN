## Spiking Neural Network

- 22.10.2024: Initial Commit
    yay

# Current (until 15.01): 
- The neurons and networks are working okay.
- Ligand-gated and ion channels are added (should we add more or probably not)

# Next Step:
- Find parameters, with MCMC or with interactive plot, Q: what is a good firing pattern and does it differ with different types or functions of neurons.
- Normalise weights
- Q: should we find if the implemented equtaions are good or not?
- Weight update rules, implement them biologically or mathmetically.
- what kind of trials can we run?
- how many neurons and layers should we have?
- if we use large amount of neurons, can we do population distribution and try bayesian. Actually can we just prove it with simple model? how to add neuron activities? 
- following the last q, should we have a storage room for prior firing? like hippocampus structure but just storing the firing 
- which above should we do first?
- what is the goal? do we do benchmarkings with different dataset like computer science with the old trials OR we do behavior science with population firing.
- should we do more time serial dataset training (because that's what SNN is good at)
